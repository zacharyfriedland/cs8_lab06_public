Letter grades will be determined by the end of the course after all labs, homeworks, and exams have been computed. What can I say? I can say that I will not grade harder than a traditional straight scale. However; I will adjust the letter grades accordingly based on your overall performance, at the end of the course!

If you are concerned about your grade in the class; I encourage you to discuss the matter with me during my office hours.

Please come talk to me sooner rather than later so there can be some time where we can help you succeed in the course.
